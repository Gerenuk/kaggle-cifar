DropConnect hacks
-----------------

See [http://fastml.com/regularizing-neural-networks-with-dropout-and-with-dropconnect/](http://fastml.com/regularizing-neural-networks-with-dropout-and-with-dropconnect) for description.

These are the files I modified to get them working (judging from modification timestamps). See if you can discern what is what. `predict_dropconnect.py` is mine, although it borrows from Li's code. The rest are mods. The main script for getting predictions is `run-dcf.sh`.
